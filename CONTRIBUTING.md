## Branch Strategy
- The `main` branch contains stable, released code.
- Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
- Rebase your branch onto `main` to keep it up to date before submitting a pull request.

## Coding Style
- Follow the conventions of the language or framework in use.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Write clear commit messages and include relevant tests when applicable.
- Use descriptive names and comments where necessary.

## Review Process
- Submit a pull request against `main` when your changes are ready.
- Ensure all tests pass and the code lints successfully.
- A maintainer will review your pull request; please address any feedback in a timely manner.
- Once approved, the pull request will be merged by a maintainer.
